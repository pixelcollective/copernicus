# Copernicus Block Framework

Documentation will be released with `v1.0.0`.

- `plugin` directory is an example implementation.
- `src` directory is what's being hacked on.

**Features:**

- Developer-focused block registration
- Command-line scaffolding tools for blocks, components, plugins, etc.
- Optionally (and awesomely) render Gutenblocks with the View Templating engine.
