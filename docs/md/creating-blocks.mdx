# Creating Blocks

## Spec

Blocks, at a minimum, feature:

### An `editor.js` file

This file should contain:

- The `registerBlockType` call
- An `edit` function
- A `save` function.

### A Laravel Blade view for the frontend

Your blade view automatically has access to `$attr` and `$content`, which correspond with the attributes and inner content markup of the block as defined in your `editor.js` file.

The `save` function is largely inconsequential to Copernicus, as the entire Save method is replaced behind-the-scenes with a callback to render a Blade template file in its stead. The exception is for blocks which contain other blocks (nested blocks). For these you can simply pass the `innerContent` to save and retrieve it in your view with `$content`.

For example:

```js
// ...
save: () => <InnerBlocks.Content />,
// ...
```

Steps to construct a new block:

## 1. Add the block to the registry

The registry is kept at `/blocks.json`.

Its contents are parsed by both the Acorn framework and Laravel Mix so as to reduce the burden on you.

This file is a simple array. Add your block's name (excluding namespacing) to this file. You can gleefully think of this as "configuring Webpack", if you wish.

Anything added to `/blocks.json` will be automatically registered with both webpack and WordPress as long as there are
corresponding scripts and views in the `/resources` directory.

## 3. Add scripts

JavaScript files are expected to be found at `/resources/assets/scripts/{namespace}/{block}`.

Copernicus will watch for the following files in this directory:

### editor.js

`editor.js` is the main entrypoint and should contain your block defintion. This is the only required asset.

### public.js

`public.js` will be enqueued only on pages which feature the block. It is strictly optional.

### react.js

`react.js`works like`public.js` but supports JSX and automatically enqueues `wp-element` (WordPress' React wrapper) as a dependency. It is strictly optional.

## 4. Add Styles

Compass files are expected to be found at `/resources/assets/styles/{namespace}/{block}`.

Copernicus will watch for the following files in this directory:

### editor.scss

`editor.scss` is for editor styles. It is strictly optional.

### public.scss

`public.scss`, like `public.js` and `react.js` will be enqueued only on pages which feature the block. It is strictly optional.


## Add a view.

Your Blade view is anticipated at `/resources/views/blocks/{namespace}/{blockname}.blade.php`.

Your blade view automatically has access to `$attr` and `$content`, which correspond with the attributes and inner content markup of the block as defined in your `editor.js` file.

This view can be extended using components, layouts, view composers, etc.
