# Getting Started

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2 or later
- WordPress 5.2 or later

Currently it is a requirement to utilize Copernicus as a companion to Sage 10. In the future this will not be a requirement. In order to sidestep this requirement you will need to manually load Acorn's View Service Provider during the `copernicus.php` startup sequence.

It is very important that both Sage 10 and Copernicus are running off the same version of Acorn. There will absolutely be issues if this guideline is not followed.

## Installation

Installation is largely very straightforward if you have workign knowledge of developing for WordPress using VCS and standard package management tools.

### Clone Copernicus from your WordPress Plugin directory

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:pixelcollective/copernicus
```

### Install PHP dependencies using Composer

```zsh
composer install
```

### Install Node dependencies using Yarn or NPM

```zsh
yarn
```

### Additional steps

We strongly recommend creating your own working branch at this point in time. This will aide in pulling new versions of Copernicus without overwriting your work.

```zsh
git checkout -b my-local-work
```

### Activate

You can always use the WordPress UI's plugin management screen. But many find WP-CLI to be the more favorable option:

```zsh
wp plugin activate copernicus
```
